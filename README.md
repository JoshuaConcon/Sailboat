# Sailböat
## Opportunity
Sailböat is a local discovery service for millennials. We aggregate nearby restaurants, bars, and eateries to provide you with results based on your preferences, budget, and proximity while you’re on the go. For businesses, Sailböat functions as a B2C platform offering you advertising space at an affordable flat rate while providing you exposure to the most influential and adventurous demographic. Through organic business reviews and in-app marketing, we drive traffic to you in an honest, low cost, and transparent manner.

## Market Opportunity

In 2017, the digital advertising for retail industry raked in $16 billion. Moving with the changing technology and millennials’ demand for speed of information, Sailböat provides everything the user desires in their hand. Similar to Tinder which has a user base of 32 million as of last year.

## Growth Potential

The model we’re planning to implement is that users will be able to use Sailböat for free, but businesses on the app will have to pay a monthly package to be on the app. Sailböat will also profit by taking a cut of each sale for when users order a deal on the app, and by selling user data to other advertising companies.

## Innovation and Competitive Differentiation
What sets Sailböat apart from the pack is that it first attracts users by offering discounted food at unconventional times, which allows users to enjoy high quality food at a reduced price. Sailböat then rewards frequent users of the app to a more curated selection of restaurants that is catered to their tasted dependent on their previous orders, to aid with this feature, users will see an overall rating of each venue as well as a rating given by like-minded users, offering a truly catered experience.

Sailböat will also users to preview restaurants through short (20 sec) atmospheric video reviews to help them decide where to eat at, allow users to easily leave text reviews for certain keywords to help businesses track their own growth, and will offer food delivery and pickup solutions in the future.

## Long-Term Development Plans

Sailböat would have used award monies to pay software developers to build the application as well as business development associates to reach out to more venues to be on the app. The money would have also been used to secure copyright licenses and legal permits that may arise during the development of the company as well as legal advising, as well as funding for conducting market research and marketing materials to advertise the app.
